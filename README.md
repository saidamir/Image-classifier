# Image-classifier
Udacity Deep Learning Image Classifier Project

Implementation of an image classifier with PyTorch.

Image classifier is trained to recognize different species of flowers. 

We'll be using this dataset http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html
of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

Load and preprocess the image dataset
Train the image classifier on your dataset
Use the trained classifier to predict image content

The project results with an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. 

Here the network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application.
